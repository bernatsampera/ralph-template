### Recipe: Add llms.txt Documentation

Read `specs/llms-txt-guide.md` to understand the llms.txt documentation system.

Analyze the project in the parent directory. Understand the tech stack, directory structure, and major subsystems.

Create tasks in `fix_plan.md` to add llms.txt files to this project:
1. Root llms.txt first
2. Domain/subsystem llms.txt files next
3. Feature-level llms.txt files last
4. Leaf documentation files as needed

Each task should create ONE file. Be specific about the exact file path to create and what content it should contain.
