There is a problem with the current ralph setup and this is that every time that I add a new example, I have to copy the ralph folder and the template folder to the new example. This is not efficient and it is not scalable.

This causes that if a new change is made to the ralph folder, I have to copy the changes to the new example. This is not efficient and it is not scalable.


How can this be improved/fixed?
