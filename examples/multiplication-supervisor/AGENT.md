# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a Ralph-style autonomous agent task. The AI directly performs file operations without writing code.

## Task Type

**Direct Execution** - The AI reads input files, performs calculations, and writes output files directly using its tools.

## Key Learnings

- Update this section when you discover new patterns or optimizations
- Document any edge cases encountered
- Keep track of successful strategies

## Quality Standards

### Task Completion Requirements

- **Accuracy**: All calculations must be mathematically correct
- **File Handling**: Input files must be read completely, output files must be written correctly
- **Validation**: Verify outputs match expected results before marking tasks complete

### Ralph Integration

- Check @fix_plan.md for current tasks before starting work
- Mark items complete in @fix_plan.md upon completion
- Read @specs/ folder for detailed task specifications
- Follow instructions in @PROMPT.md for the autonomous loop

## Task Completion Checklist

Before marking ANY task as complete, verify:

- [ ] Input file read correctly
- [ ] Calculation performed accurately
- [ ] Output file written with correct result
- [ ] Result matches expected value from specs
- [ ] @fix_plan.md task marked as complete

## Workflow

1. Read @PROMPT.md for instructions
2. Check @fix_plan.md for pending tasks
3. Read @specs/ for task details
4. Execute tasks using available tools
5. Update @fix_plan.md upon completion
6. Report status at end of loop
