## High Priority

- [] Read input/001.txt, multiply 5 x 3, write 15 to output/001.txt
- [] Read input/002.txt, multiply 7 x 4, write 28 to output/002.txt
- [] Read input/003.txt, multiply 10 x 2, write 20 to output/003.txt

## Completed

- [x] Project setup and configuration

## Notes

- Each input file contains two numbers (one per line)
- Output files should contain only the product (single number)
