# Fix Plan

## High Priority


- [ ] Analyze the current repository and it's folder and file structure and analyze which are the main sections and files that are important to understand the codebase. Write your findings in a markdown file called `specs/codebase-structure.md`.

- [ ] Read the `specs/codebase-structure.md` file and understand the codebase structure. Then write a task in the current fix_plan.md to understand each section and file and write a description of what it does and how it works. In this task, besides just reading the file, a more deep dive into the codebase is needed. The findings will be written in a markdown file called `specs/section_name/details.md`.

### Sections
... write here the sections

### Final TASK

- [ ] **Create Overall Flow**: Read `specs/flow_blueprint.md` for the template structure. Then read ALL previously generated detail files in specs/section_name/details.md. Synthesize all findings into a comprehensive flow document showing how all parts of the codebase connect and interact. Write findings to `specs/overall-flow.md`.


- [ ] In specs/codebase-structure.md, add next to each respective section the corresponding analyzed detail file for this sections in the format specs/section_name/details.md.
